A child is a kind of non-player-character.

There is a child.

The child's spc-pronoun-list is "they, them, themself".

Whenever the game-turn advances,
 the child has no visible-items;
 also the child perceives the child;
 also the child surveys the child's container.

When a child annotates a map-portal with a map-direction,
 the child composes {{the map-portal} towards {the map-direction}}.

When a child references a photograph,
 the child recites "the photo".

When a child references a player-character,
 the child recites "some oldster".

When a player-character shows a photograph to a child,
 the child perceives it and its container;
 also the child says "I wonder who that is?".
